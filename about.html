                    Central to <i>Lived Experiences</i> is the concept of storytelling: the social and cultural activity of
                    sharing
                    stories, sometimes with improvisation, theatrics or embellishment as a means for sharing and
                    interpreting
                    experiences. This interdisciplinary and collaborative project adopts the storytelling approach to
                    exploring
                    the experience of race in Miami University's history to engage students, faculty, staff, and alumni
                    in
                    searching reflection on the history of race relations at Miami and beyond. We believe that
                    institutions
                    that
                    are publicly committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion must offer their communities
                    opportunities to
                    articulate their experience, hear and discuss the experiences of others, past and present, and work
                    together
                    to reconcile these experiences and move toward the goals we have set for ourselves.

                    Phase One of the <i>Lived Experiences Through Storytelling: Race at Miami University </i> launched in
                    February
                    2023 with seed funding from the Boldly Creative Initiative at Miami University. The Offices of the 
                    President and the Provost were instrumental in supporting the pilot project. <i>Lived Experiences</i> is a
                    collaboration between the Miami University Libraries, University Advancement, the Humanities Center,
                    the
                    Departments of Educational Leadership, History, Psychology, and the Media, Journalism, and Film, and
                    the
                    Oxford community. Additional funding was provided by the 
                    <a href="https://humanitiescenter.miamioh.edu/">Humanities Center</a> and the 
                    <a href="https://www.oxfordfdn.org/">Greater Oxford Community Foundation</a>.

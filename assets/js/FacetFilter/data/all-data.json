From a young age he displayed an impressive athletic ability in track and football. These talents combined with a drive to continue his education led him to attend Miami University in 1937. He attended Miami University for four years, working towards a physical education and industrial arts degree. Jerry broke multiple barriers during his time at Miami as a student athlete. \n\nAs the first African American student in Miami’s history to compete in variety sports Jerry paved the road for future students. He earned a spot on the football team as a half-back and led the team to the Buckeye Conference championship during his sophomore year. His senior year he was one of the first African American students to compete against a segregated school on Miami’s home field. In boxing, Jerry won the southwestern Ohio divisional Golden Gloves back to back years. Jerry Williams is considered one of the greatest athletes to ever attend Miami University. \n\nJerry Williams spent four years at Miami University working towards his degree and completing all his required classes. He was barred from earning his degree because of racial discrimination, which precluded him from completing the required student teaching. Jerry did not find a teaching position in Butler County but he returned to Cleveland and was hired. He was hired as a physical education coach in Cleveland City Schools. After his first year, he was let go because he still lacked a teaching license. Miami withheld Jerry’s degree, refusing to count his year of work towards his student teaching requirement. The City Schools petitioned the university to credit his year of teaching in Cleveland to count toward a teaching license but the request was rejected. Despite never receiving his degree during his life, Jerry spent his career as a teacher; he taught history, industrial arts, language studies, social studies, English, and after retiring he would occasionally return as a substitute. \n\nJerry William remained without his degree until 2013 when Honors Program Director Zeb Baker discovered correspondence between former university president Alfred P. Upham and Cleveland City Schools superintendent Charles H. Lake. This correspondence revealed Upham agreed that Jerry Williams had completed all of his requirements. Dr. Baker presented the evidence to Dr. Ron Scott, Associate Vice President of Institutional Diversity, who agreed that Williams should receive his bachelor’s degree posthumously. This led to Dr. Michael Dantley, Dean of the College of Education, Health and Society reaching out to Janis Williams, Jerry Williams' daughter. Janis Williams was told her father would finally be awarded his degree. Janis and Jerry Jr. accepted their father’s degree in his place. As Janis said of her father’s posthumous accomplishment, “Wow, you finally got it and you deserved it.”","citations":"Fathuer, George (1938, October 7).

Born on November 25th, 1906 to Francis Spurlock and Florence Troy Spurlock in Ohio, Lucetta spent her early years in Chicago, Illinois, where Francis worked as a chauffeur for a private family. Following her father’s death at an early age, Lucetta and her mother moved to Oxford, Ohio, where Florence’s brother, Thaddeus Garnett Troy, was already employed by Miami University as a janitor. Florence was hired to work at Miami, first as a cook and later as a maid. During this time, another Black family employed by the university, the Taylors, resided with Florence and Lucetta in the Spurlock home on South Oak Street. Florence would eventually marry one of the Taylor brothers, Altree, in 1950— the couple is buried together at Woodside Cemetery in Oxford.\n\nLucetta enrolled in the Teacher College at Miami in the fall of 1925 at the age of eighteen. While a student, she worked for the university alongside her mother, employed as a housecleaner tasked with wiping dishes and performing maid services. Lucetta was an active member of the Y.W.C.A. on campus, serving on the board from 1926 to 1928. She was also a founding member of Kappa Sigma Delta, organized in 1929 as the first known African American student organization on campus. Lucetta and the fellow members of Kappa Sigma Delta unsuccessfully petitioned for the organization to be recognized as an official fraternity in 1932— it would take another six years of operating as an unofficial student organization for Kappa Sigma Delta to be recognized by Miami under the name “The Colored Students Club” in 1938. Upon graduating with a bachelor’s degree in education in 1928, Lucetta returned to Miami as a graduate student to pursue her master’s degree. It was at Miami that she met George Theodore Tanner, class of 1930. Like Lucetta, George— alongside his father and siblings— had worked for Miami as a janitor during his early adulthood. George and Lucetta married in 1930; in the following years, the couple would move to Dayton, Ohio and give birth to their two sons, Theodore and Troy.\n\nIn addition to working as a public school teacher, Lucetta also worked for the Dayton Public Library, the Montgomery County Public Assistance, and the Montgomery County Divorce Court. She retired from the Cleveland Board of Education in 1972, where she had moved after her marriage to her second husband, Ralph Pinkston. Lucetta attended the 1985 Black Alumni Reunion at Miami, making her one of the three oldest alumni in attendance alongside Louise Clark McBain (Class of 1932) and Thomas M. Cheeks (Class of 1929). She recalled her favorite campus memory as her time on the Y.W.C.A. board and attending the Y.W.C.A. Conference at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.\n  \nLucetta passed away July 26th, 1987 at the age of eighty.","citations":"Ancestry.com and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. *1880 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

Kelley made Miami history in 1908 by becoming the first male African American student to be enrolled at the Ohio State Normal College (what evolved into the Teachers College and is now known as the Miami University College of Education, Health, and Society), only three years after Nellie Craig became Miami’s first African American graduate in 1905. Born on March 15th, 1889 to Thomas Kelley and Jennie Gibson Kelley in Hamilton, Ohio, Earl moved to Oxford, Ohio at an early age with his mother and his older brother, Edward, following the divorce of his parents. An Oxford native, Jennie’s siblings Mary, Simon, and Emery were all employed by Miami University to perform labor and housekeeping jobs. Jennie began working as a laundress in Oxford before remarrying in 1903 to Logan Peak.\n\nKelley enrolled at the Normal College in 1908, pursuing a two year teaching degree in manual training. He was a member of the Manual Arts Club on campus and graduated in 1910. After graduation, Earl married Mildred Bruner— the daughter of Peter Bruner, a formerly enslaved Civil War veteran and Miami’s earliest known Black employee— in 1912. The couple had three children together, Helen, Harold, and Thomas. Several of his family members followed in his footsteps to attend Miami— Harold attended from 1932 to 1934, his daughter-in-law, Elizabeth Rile Kelley, graduated with a Bachelor’s of Arts in French in 1933, and Thomas earned his Masters of Science in Education from Miami in 1954.\n\nFollowing his years at Miami, Kelley worked for the Welsh and Stewart families in Oxford, chauffeuring and maintaining the home and grounds. At the same time, he worked as a custodian for the Farmers State Bank under J. Gilbert Welsh, where he stayed until his retirement in 1975. An employee for sixty years, Kelley was the longest serving employee of the then First Citizens Barnitz banking firm— the original Farmers State Bank building had changed ownership a number of times throughout his career and now operates as a Chase Bank— upon his retirement. Kelley served on the Oxford City Council for two terms from 1958 to 1961. In 1967, he was recognized as Oxford’s Citizen of the Year.\n \nEarl T. Kelley passed away on May 27th 1978 at the age of eighty-nine. At the time of his passing, he was one of the oldest living members of the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Oxford.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1900 United States Federal Census* [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations Inc, 2004.

One of four children, he was born on September 27th, 1933 in Springfield, Ohio to parents Esmond and Naomi Bronston. Robert attended Springfield High School, where he was a member of the varsity basketball team that won the state championship title in 1950. He graduated in 1951.\n\nRobert enrolled at Miami in the fall of 1951 as an education major. A star student athlete, he played for the football team all four years of his college career under Coach Ara Parseghian, and was named “Most Valuable Junior Player” his junior year, and team captain his senior year. He was elected to the Athletic Board of Controls, the advisory council composed of students and faculty, in 1954. Despite his athletic success, Robert’s football career at Miami still saw incidents of racial prejudice and discrimination. One such incident took place during a trip to Wichita his freshman year, when he and ten of his African American teammates were forced to stay in a single hotel room at a separate, lesser quality hotel, while his white coaches and teammates slept comfortably in a nicer hotel across town. \n\nRobert was involved in a number of other student organizations, serving as both president of Tribe Miami— the varsity letterman's association— and Junior Vice President. He was also a member of the Air Force ROTC on campus. He graduated from Miami in 1955. According to an interview with Bronston in 1996, Parseghian informed Bronston that he wanted him to stay at Miami to work alongside him as an assistant coach following his graduation, the head football coach told him that the university trustees would not allow it because he was Black. \n\n\nShortly after graduation, Robert began teaching and coaching football at Springfield South High School— he was the first Black teacher in the district to teach at the secondary level and the first Black football coach both at Springfield and in the now defunct Greater Ohio League athletic conference. In his 1996 interview, Bronston noted how his hiring at Springfield was controversial and prompted five white teachers to threaten to quit the district. He married Beverly Crawford, Miami class of 1956, on June 9th, 1956. The couple had two children together, Rhonda and Tracey. Robert taught at Springfield South High School for eighteen years before being named Dean of Students at Springfield North High School, where he continued to work until he retired in 1984. He holds a master’s degree in education from Wright State University.\n\nRobert was an active member of the Springfield community throughout his life. As a member of the Center Street Y.M.C.A., he served both as chairman of the health and physical committee and as a member of the Board of Directors beginning in 1963. He was appointed to Springfield Metropolitan Housing Authority board of commissioners in 1974, which he served on until 1980. In 1977, Bronston was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame. He was also the recipient of numerous community awards and recognitions, including the Davey Moore Cultural Plaque in 1987 and Springfield City School District “Alumni of Distinction Award” in 2017","citations":"“Alumni of Distinction.” Springfield City School District. https://www.scsdoh.org/page/alumni-of-distinction. \n\nAncestry.com. *1940 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

He was born on May 13th, 1879 in Fukushima, Japan to parents Seiga and Kame Tomizawa. Although Kiyoshi’s father was the minister of religion for the Sōma samurai clan during the Tokugawa Shogunate, the Tomizawa family lost much of its wealth and prestige when the Meiji Restoration of 1868 stripped daimyō feudal lords of their authority. Kiyoshi’s childhood was defined by economic insecurity— unable to afford the cost of raising three children, his father decided to send both him and his younger sister to be adopted by another family, the Kataokas, in 1890. Kiyoshi would return to the Tomizawa household in 1897 at the age of eighteen before moving to Sendai to attend Tohoku Gakuin University. It was there that he met Dr. John Raleigh Mott, founder of the World Student Christian Organization and later the head of the Y.M.C.A., a role for which he would win the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize. Inspired by Mott’s work, Tomizawa began to learn English and moved to San Francisco in November of 1903. He lived in the United States for a few years before enrolling at Miami University in the fall of 1908 to pursue a Liberal Arts degree.\n\nKiyoshi spent his first year on campus as a “special student” in the Academy, a Miami-run college prep program for high school students. Rather than residing in a dorm the following years, he stayed at the house of Professor Fred W. Stone. Involved in a number of student organizations, Tomizawa was a member of the gymnastics team, the Miami Union Literary Society, the Phrenocon Association (previously the non-Fraternity Association and later changing its name to Phi Kappa Tau, as it is known today), and the German club “Der Deutsche Verein”. He graduated in the spring of 1912, returning to Japan shortly after to teach English in Tokyo. It was there that he married Fumi Mezawa in 1913 before returning to the United States for permanent residency in 1914, settling down in San Francisco. The couple had four children together.\n\nTomizawa began working as an assistant secretary for the Japanese Chamber of Commerce upon his return to the United States. He was then hired as executive secretary for the Sutter Street Branch (also known as the Japanese Branch) of the San Francisco Y.M.C.A. upon its formation in 1918. For the next decade, Tomizawa worked tirelessly alongside other members of the Japanese American community of San Francisco to raise funds for a permanent home for the Japanese Branch. By the end of 1928, they had raised $40,000 in funds towards the purchase of a new building, received from donors in the United States and Japan alike. Thanks to these efforts, the location for the new Japanese Y.M.C.A. was purchased in March of 1929 and, after several financial setbacks due to the onset of the Great Depression, the building finally opened its doors in January of 1936. It is still operating today as the Buchanan Y.M.C.A.. In 1937, Tomizawa was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of his extraordinary career with the Japanese Y.M.C.A.. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president.\n \nThough Kiyoshi retired from the Japanese Y.M.C.A. in 1939, the impact of his work on the Japan Town community continued long after his career at the Y ended, especially in the hearts and minds of the people he served. In 1942, Chojuro Numajiri, who worked at the Japanese Branch for twenty-three years, recalled working alongside Tomizawa: “I have yet to meet a more sincere Christian and a finer gentleman.” Troy Ishikawa, son of Roy Ishikawa, who lived at the Sutter Street Y.M.C.A. for a brief time in the 1930s, wrote a 2011 blog post in which he recalled Kiyoshi encouraging his father and other *kibei* (Japanese Americans born in the U.S. who, after being raised and educated in Japan, return to the states as an adult) to register to vote. As an *issei*, or first generation Japanese immigrant, Tomizawa was ineligible for citizenship and therefore could not vote, but wanted to ensure that the younger generation would give voice to Japanese American interests and problems facing their communities.\n\nFollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Tomizawa, like many other Japanese Americans at the time, was investigated by the FBI for fear of potential espionage— a December 1941 FBI memo put him on a list of Japanese non-citizens to be considered for custodial detention. When Japanese internment began in 1942, he was given a choice: either join the hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans forcibly relocated to internment camps, or serve the U.S. government as a Japanese instructor at the U.S. Navy Japanese Language School (soon renamed the Navy School of Oriental Languages) in Boulder, Colorado. Tomizawa chose the latter and began teaching Japanese to naval officers at the University of Colorado Boulder. He continued teaching at the Navy School of Oriental Languages into the 1950s before moving back to San Francisco to spend the rest of his retirement.\n\nKiyoshi Tomizawa passed away on August 5th, 1964 at the age of eighty-five.","citations":"“Alumni Notes.” *The Miami Student*, Vol. 43, No. 16, Jan. 30, 1919.

The oldest of four siblings born to Dock and Essie Watson, Hattie was born on April 23rd, 1911 in Middletown, Ohio, where her father worked at the local steel mill. She attended Middletown High School, graduating in 1929.\nHattie enrolled in Miami that fall, majoring in education. An accomplished student athlete, she played soccer, ran track and field (where she set a discus record at the annual Women’s Field Meet in 1932), and was a member of the Women’s Athletic Association on campus. During her senior year, Hattie received the “M” sweater, the most prestigious award that a student athlete in the Women’s Athletic Association can earn. She was also a founding member of Kappa Sigma Delta, organized in 1929 as the first known African American student organization on campus. Hattie and the fellow members of Kappa Sigma Delta unsuccessfully petitioned for the organization to be recognized as an official fraternity in 1932— it would take another six years of operating as an unofficial student organization for Kappa Sigma Delta to be recognized by Miami under the name “The Colored Students Club” in 1938. Though Miami did not have a chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha— the first intercollegiate, historically African American sorority— while she was a student, there was an Ivy Leaf Pledge Club on campus beginning in 1931, allowing Miami women interested in joining AKA to become candidates for initiation in surrounding undergraduate chapters. Many of these women, including Hattie, were initiated into AKA through the nearby Omicron chapter at the University of Cincinnati. She and the other Miami AKAs were therefore considered “Stray Greeks”, as they belonged to a group of students whose fraternity or sorority were not represented on Miami’s campus. Miami would eventually charter their own chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in 1977.\nAfter graduating from Miami in 1933, Hattie returned to Middletown and began teaching for Middletown Public Schools. She married Samuel Holmes, a steel mill worker, in the late 1930s. They had two children together, Marilyn and Walter.\nHattie passed away on May 27th, 1978 at the age of sixty-seven.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1920 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

Born June 15, 1907, to Sidney Cheeks and Mary Alice Bruner Cheeks, Thomas was raised in Oxford, Ohio. Thomas grew up near campus at 208 University Avenue. Thomas was the youngest of seven children. He attended Oxford Public School from first grade through high school. When asked in a July 19th, 1988 interview about what made him decide to go to Miami, Thomas said he decided to attend Miami when the four-year program of physical education, athletic coaching, and athletic directorship was created in May 1925.\n\nIn the same 1988 interview, Thomas discussed the coaching program describing the curriculum as challenging and requiring the completion of 132 credit hours to graduate. To complete his degree in time Thomas took eighteen credit hours all four years of his education. To fulfill his required practice teaching assignment, Thomas went to East high school in Xenia, Ohio. He spent nine weeks teaching while living with his sister, Ethel who lived near the high school. Thomas was also an active member of Omega Psi Phi, a historically African American fraternity founded in 1911. \n\nWhen Thomas Cheeks started at Miami University Mr. Roudebush ensured he received a job as a janitor according to the 1988 interview. Thomas was paid forty cents an hour to work. He was responsible for two buildings, Benton Hall and Brice Hall. Thomas worked two hours each weekday and eight hours on Saturday. His father, Sidney Cheeks worked full time as a janitor at Miami University and helped Thomas look after his buildings in addition to his own work. In a 1988 interview, Thomas shared he had his tuition waived since his father worked at Miami. \n\nAfter graduating from Miami in 1929 Thomas continued his education as a graduate student at Indiana University. He and his wife Diana B. settled in Indiana where Thomas held a coaching position at Lincoln High School. Thomas stayed at the school for twenty years working as both a coach and a teacher. In January of 1964 a teaching opportunity led Thomas to move to Milwaukee where he continued his teaching career and was the chairman of the social studies department. In 1976 Thomas Cheeks was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of his extraordinary career as an educator and coach. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president. \n\nThomas' story starts with his father's experience, when Sidney Cheeks and his parents and siblings left West Virginia to escape the aftermath of the War. Born October 26, 1866, Sidney was an infant when his family settled in Oxford, Ohio. Sidney met Mary Bruner in Oxford and they were married on October 10, 1888. Mary Bruner was born October 1868 and passed away November 11, 1946. Sidney ran a dairy farm in addition to his thirty-year career as a janitor at Miami University. Sidney passed away at the age of seventy-two on March 19, 1938.\n\nSidney and Mary had seven children; Stanley, Robert, Ethel, Ruth, Mable, Carrie, and Thomas. Stanley Cheeks stayed in Oxford, Ohio his whole life, according to a 1981 interview with his brother Robert Cheeks. Robert , born April 25, 1895 shared in a 1981 interview that he did not attend Miami University because at the time Miami was not accepting African American students. Robert worked as a general contractor, farmer, florist, and trader. In the 1981 interview he stated that he owned and built multiple buildings in Oxford, Ohio as a way to provide for his family. Robert married Loretta Poston and had two children, James Cheeks and Isabelle Cheeks, who both graduated from Miami University. Carrie Cheeks Morgan, the second youngest Cheeks sibling, also attended Miami University. Born July 4th, 1904, she attended a two-year education school at Miami University. After graduating she moved to Chicago to start her career in office work but returned to Oxford with her husband Charles Morgan after her mother passed.\n\nThe maternal grandfather of the seven siblings was Peter Bruner. Peter Bruner was born into slavery in Kentucky. He was separated from his family to work as a tanner. During the Civil War, he escaped slavery to join the Union Army at Camp Nelson. After the war, he settled in Oxford, Ohio as a free man. Peter worked as a custodian and messenger at Miami University, Western Female Seminary, and Oxford College. He was the first African American man to work at Miami University. Peter, with the help of this family, preserved his memories in an autobiography, *A Slave's Adventures Toward Freedom*. Peter passed away on April 6, 1938. Many of Peter Bruner’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren graduated from Miami University including Carrie Cheeks Morgan, Isabel Cheeks Lewis, Thomas Kelly, Margaret Greene McClain, James Cheeks, and Thomas Monroe Cheeks.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *Ohio, U.S., Births and Christenings Index, 1774-1973* [database on-line].

Chong was born in Hilo, Hawaii on August 14th, 1916 to Charles Chong Man and En Fung Pung— his father was born in Canton, China and immigrated to the United States in the 1890s while his mother was born in Hawaii to Chinese parents. Wing Kong grew up in a neighborhood of Hilo known as “Chongville” after his father, who owned and operated the local meat market. After graduating from Hilo High School in 1936, he became enrolled at the University of Hawaii, spending two years as a student there before transferring to Miami through a foreign exchange program— as Hawaii was still considered a U.S. territory at the time— funded by the Miami University Chest Fund.\n\nAs a student at Miami, Chong studied education and was involved in various activities on campus. A member of both Tau Kappa Alpha, an honor society for public speaking, and the Speakers Bureau, he regularly gave speeches to local rotary clubs and community organizations about his experiences living in Hawaii. He was also a member of the Cosmopolitan Club, a student organization that welcomed students of diverse backgrounds, where he served as Sergeant at Arms. Though his exchange scholarship expired at the end of his junior year, Miami president Alfred Horatio Upham offered to waive his tuition for the 1939-1940 school year, praising Chong as “a fine young man who makes friends readily, and is the type we need rather badly, located as we are so far from either seaboard.” He graduated from Miami in the spring of 1940 before attending Columbia University for his master’s degree in education, graduating in 1941.\n\nAfter moving back to Hawaii, Wing Kong taught at Mountain View Elementary, Hilo Intermediate School, and Hilo High School. He married Ethel Ishii in 1948— the couple had three children together, Curtis, Clayton, and Elisa. Chong became involved in politics in the 1960s, serving on the Board of Supervisors of Hawaii County from 1960 to 1962. He was elected to Hawaii’s House of Representatives from 1971 to 1974, and ran for mayor of Hawaii County in 1972 and 1974. In 1975, Chong was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, in recognition of his extraordinary career as a teacher and public servant. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president.\n \nFollowing his political career, Chong continued to work in the insurance business as an employee of American Mutual. He remained active in the Hilo community as a boy scout leader for over thirty years.\n\nWing Kong passed away April 25th, 2006, at the age of eighty-nine.\n","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1920 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

Born March 26, 1937, Wayne was raised in Springfield, Ohio. Wayne Embry, as a Miami University student and alumnus, has worked to improve this University in so many ways.\n\nWayne started his Miami basketball career in 1956 and remained on the team until he graduated in 1958. He was affectionately called Goose by his teammates. Wayne led Miami to two Mid-American Conference (MAC) titles and two appearances in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) between 1957- 1958. Wayne set seven career records and was the first Miami University basketball player to reach 1000 points and 1000 rebounds. Wayne earned his membership in Tribe Miami by lettering in basketball, and he was a valued member of Alpha Phi Alpha, the historically African-American fraternity active on MU’s campus. When he graduated in 1958, Wayne asked if he could remain on the coaching staff as a graduate assistant. He was told he could not do so because of his race, as he noted in his 1970 Hall of Fame induction speech. \n\nWayne married his college sweetheart Theresa. Theresa (Terri) completed her Bachelor’s degree in Education at Miami in 1960. Terri marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama with Martin Luther King Jr. as part of a series of civil rights protests that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and spent the rest of her life fighting for racial equality. Terri served on the Education, Health, and Society (EHS) Teachers Advisory Committee at Miami University, and on two separate boards of the Urban League, in Cleveland and Milwaukee. Terri passed away August 27, 2020, at the age of eighty- two. Together Wayne and Terri had three children; Debbi, Jill, and Wayne Jr.\n\nWayne Embry shifted his plans when he was drafted into the National Basketball Association (NBA). Wayne played professional basketball for eleven years, starting with the Cincinnati Royals for eight years, two years with the Boston Celtics, and a final year with the Milwaukee Bucks until retiring in 1969. Embry was the first African American in NBA history to be a general manager and team president. After a brief time as Director of Recreation for the City of Boston, Embry returned to Milwaukee to serve as vice president and general manager of the Bucks from 1972 to 1977. He was later President of MALCO, a Milwaukee-based auto industrial firm, and Wayne joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as general manager in 1986.\n\nWayne Embry’s extraordinary contributions to professional basketball, civic service, and Miami University have been recognized in many ways by the University. Wayne received the university’s Distinguished Achievement Medal in 2001. Miami University unveiled a statue of the NBA basketball star on May 18, 2021. In addition at the May 18th event, Miami University also presented Embry and his late wife, Terri with the Freedom Summer of ’64 Award which is presented every year to a distinguished leader who has inspired the nation to advance civil rights and social justice.

Born on August 18th, 1932 to parents William Hargraves and Annie Leona Thomas Hargraves, William II was raised in Covington, Kentucky, where both of his parents taught at the Lincoln-Grant School, a segregated public K-12 school building for African American students consisting of both an elementary school, Lincoln School, and a high school, William Grant High School. William II worked a construction job during his teenage years and graduated as valedictorian of the William Grant High School in the spring of 1950 before enrolling at Miami University that fall.\n \nAt the time of his enrollment, the Hargraves family already shared a rich history with both Miami and the Oxford community as a whole. William II’s grandparents Hammond Arthur Hargraves and Anna Langford Hargraves moved to Oxford 1911— she was employed as a cook and Hammond as a janitor. His father William Hargraves I made Miami history in 1925 when he and Eleanor Reece became the first two African American students to earn a four-year bachelor’s degree from the university. His uncle, Langford Hargraves, attended Miami beginning in 1924 and, although he finished his degree at Wilberforce University, he returned to Miami to work as a pool technician in the campus athletic facilities. His aunt, Edythe Hargraves, graduated from Miami with an education degree in 1943. She worked at Miami as a secretary until her passing in 1947 and, according to her family, was the first African American to be professionally hired by the university.\n\nDuring his time at Miami, William was active in a vast number of student organizations spanning a multitude of interests, talents, and skills. A dedicated musician, he was involved in both marching band and concert band— where he served as vice president and president—, as well as Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a music fraternity. In 1953, Hargraves became one of the nine founding members of Miami’s Delta Upsilon chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha, the oldest intercollegiate historically Black fraternity in the United States. He was involved in several religious groups on campus— he served as vice president of Sigma Theta Epsilon, a Methodist fraternity, and as president of the Bethel Extension for the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Oxford. His membership in other fraternities and honor societies included the following: Phi Beta Kappa, an academic honor society, Kappa Delta Pi, an honor society for education (vice president); Pi Mu Epsilon, a professional mathematics society; Kappa Phi Kappa, an organization for men interested in becoming professors (vice president); Sigma Pi Sigma, an honor society for physics and astronomy; and Omicron Delta Kappa, a select and prestigious honor society recognizing exceptional leaders. In two of these organizations— Phi Beta Kappa and Omicron Delta Kappa— he was the first Black student at Miami to be elected to membership. As a cadet in the Air Force ROTC, Hargraves was selected to be a part of the Arnold Air Society, an honorary organization for officer candidates. He was also active in the Campus Interracial Club and Student Faculty Council. William graduated in the spring of 1954 with a Bachelor of Science in Education.\n\nShortly following his graduation, Hargraves was commissioned as an officer in the United States Air Force and awarded a graduate assistantship in physics at Miami. After completing a year of graduate work at his alma mater, he reported for active duty, moving to the Bainbridge Air Base in Georgia for a six month period before relocating to Texas. It was there that he met his first wife, Maurine Collins, an organist and public school teacher. The couple married in 1957 and had three sons together. Hargraves returned to Miami in 1959 on a grant-in-aid scholarship to complete his master’s degree in physics, which he earned in 1961. He spent the following years serving as an air liaison officer in Vietnam, flying two-hundred combat missions and earning a number of awards and commendations, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal. In 1971, he accepted a position with Miami University as an associate professor of air science, becoming the first Black staff officer for Miami’s ROTC, where he remained until 1974. He then worked at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as Chief of Flight Deck Research and Development before becoming the Deputy Division Chief at the Pentagon in the early 1980s. Hargraves, ranked a colonel, retired from the Air Force in 1982 after thirty years of service as a pilot, instructor, air liaison officer, researcher, and professor. He spent the next twenty-eight years at Central State University, a historically Black university in Wilberforce, Ohio, first as an assistant professor and then as assistant dean of arts and sciences. During his time at Central State, he was recognized with the Teacher of the Year Award, Most Popular Professor Award, and Most Inspirational Teaching Award. Within the Oxford community, he served on the Oxford Housing Board of Appeals, was a trustee emeritus at Bethel A.M.E. Church, and continued his passion for music through playing the piano and singing for his congregation. After Maurine passed away in 2005, William remarried to his second wife, Gene.\n\nColonel William Hargraves II passed away on January 21st, 2019 at the age of eighty-six and is buried in Woodside Cemetery.","citations":"“1954 Miami Graduate Is Associate Professor of Air Force ROTC Staff.” *The Journal News*, July 1, 1971, p. 50.

Born September 9th, 1909 to William Alonzo “Lonnie” Rile and Martha Rile, Elizabeth grew up in Union County, Indiana where Lonnie worked the family farm. Lonnie’s father, James M. Rile, had fought in the U.S. Colored Troops regiment of the Union Army during the Civil War and was part of a larger migration of African Americans from Boone County, Kentucky to the Oxford area during the Reconstruction era. The Rile family moved from Union County to Oxford in the 1920s, where Martha became employed as a servant for a private family. Elizabeth’s cousin, Franklin Rile, and his wife, Lucy Rile, were both employed at Miami University as a house man and maid, respectively.\n\nDuring her years at Miami, Elizabeth became active in the Cosmopolitan Club and the Young Women’s Christian Association, both student organizations that included diverse membership. She was a founding member of the Kappa Sigma Delta Club, an organization formed by a group of Black students in 1929 and the first known African American organization on Miami’s campus. Kappa Sigma Delta petitioned to be recognized by the university as an official fraternity in 1932, but was denied and remained an unofficial organization until Miami recognized them under the name “The Color Students Club” in 1938. She was also involved in Alpha Kappa Alpha— though Miami did not have a chapter of the historically African American sorority at the time, there was an Ivy Leaf Pledge Club on campus beginning in 1931, allowing Miami women interested in joining AKA to become candidates for initiation in surrounding undergraduate chapters. Many of these women, including Elizabeth, were then initiated into AKA through the nearby Omicron chapter at the University of Cincinnati. She and the other Miami AKAs were therefore considered “Stray Greeks”, as they belonged to a group of students whose fraternity or sorority were not represented on Miami’s campus. It was at Miami that Elizabeth met her future husband, Harold B. Kelley, who attended the university from 1932 to 1934. Harold’s father, Earl T. Kelley, made Miami history in 1908 by becoming the first African American student to enroll at the university. Elizabeth and Harold would eventually wed in 1937, settling down together in Richmond, Indiana.\n\nElizabeth’s life post-Miami would see the birth of her two children, Marilyn and Harold W. In 1947, she and Harold Sr.— along with Elizabeth’s sister Ina and her husband Henry R. Bass— would open the Specialty Record Shop in downtown Richmond. The record store, owned and operated by the Kelleys and the Basses, became the first black owned retail business in the Richmond area to sell to black and white patrons alike. The shelves of the Specialty Record Shop were lined with records representing a variety of artists, genres, and labels, providing a diverse array of music and, in turn, challenging some of the cultural and color barriers that defined popular music at the time. Elizabeth worked alongside her family in various positions over the years, including secretary, advertising person, treasurer, and bookkeeper, before the shop closed its doors in 1980.\n\nAs a small business owner, Elizabeth was an active player in the Richmond community. She continued her involvement in the Y.W.C.A. following her years at Miami, serving on the board of directors as chairperson of the World Fellowship Committee in 1959. She was president of the Finley School P.T.A.. Elizabeth was a member of the Women’s Club beginning in 1964. After a natural gas leak in downtown triggered an explosion in downtown Richmond in 1968— killing forty-one people, injuring over 120, destroying fifteen buildings, and damaging 125 more— Elizabeth was one of three women selected to sit on the planning commission for a promenade to be built downtown in honor of the victims. From 1972 to 1976, she was a member of the Women’s Auxiliary of the Richmond Symphony Orchestra.\n\nElizabeth and Harold Sr. were active in Miami alumni life as well— she attended the 50th anniversary celebration for the class of 1933 in 1985, and they both attended the 1985 Black Alumni Reunion. It was in the 1985 Black Alumni Reunion Record that Elizabeth listed her favorite campus memory as the bond she formed with Frances Helen Mains, the Y.W.C.A. director during Elizabeth’s college years, “who was compassionate and helped me to feel welcome to sit there when I was tired and lonely.”\n\nElizabeth passed away September 23rd, 1997 at age eighty-eight.","citations":"Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

Through a football scholarship Franklin attended Miami and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1946. Not only did he accomplish his main goal, he made impactful changes that altered Miami University and the lives of students going forward. In a 2004 interview, Franklin credited his success as a student to the African American community in Oxford that cared and supported him. He shared that, “it was in those days I'll tell you there wasn't any family I couldn't go to stay at their house, they would feed me come see me and play ball everybody knew everybody.” Franklin’s career and life after graduation was dedicated to helping and inspiring others.\n\nIn addition to his football career Franklin was deeply invested in Miami’s clubs, organizations, and sports teams. He co-founded and was president of Miami's Campus Interracial Club. The Campus Interracial Club was created to address racial tensions on campus through the call for reform and actions by African American students on campus. He was a dedicated member of Delta Sigma Theta, a fraternity whose purpose was to create a more intimate Christian fellowship among men of Methodist preference. He was a member of Tribe Miami, the university's organization of varsity lettermen, all of whom received the varsity letter award for accomplishments in varsity sports. Franklin was deeply involved in sports including football, boxing, and track. While Franklin was an impressive football player an injury led him to end his career and focus on other sports. Franklin was in the heavyweight division in boxing as a six foot two inch tall man weighing in at two hundred and thirty pounds. The track team was especially important to Franklin, his coach Geoge had a heavy influence on Franklin's life.\n\nWhen he was asked in 2004 what his impressions of Coach George Rider were, Franklin said, “He was my second father.” Franklin shared that he and Coach Rider kept in touch regularly after graduation. Franklin's admiration for Rider was evident in his portrait of the coach. He spent over forty years of his life teaching art, and coaching football.  Franklin coached football, basketball, and track at DePores, Purcell, Princeton and Winton Woods High Schools.\n\nFranklin grew up in Lincoln Heights in northern Cincinnati. After graduating from Miami he returned to the West End where Franklin taught students for the nineteen years the school was open. In 1971 Franklin Shands was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of his extraordinary career as an educator and coach. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president. Franklin received this medal for his endless service to help others have a better life.  Franklin married Christine Johnson Shands, together they had six children. On February 2, 2005, at the age of 84, Franklin Shands passed away. He left behind generations of students whose lives were changed for the better by his hard work and dedication into their future success.","citations":"Summerlin, LaVerne Muldow. “Chapter 11.” Essay.

Born on May 2nd, 1904 to George Tanner, Sr. and Nannie Bedenbaugh Tanner, George— sometimes going by his middle name, Theodore, to distinguish himself from his father— grew up in Oxford, Ohio, where both the Tanner and the Bedenbaugh family relocated during the Reconstruction era as part of a larger migration of African Americans from Boone County, Kentucky to the Oxford area. George Sr. was employed as a laborer for Miami University, as were Nannie’s brothers, Glen and Walter Bedenbaugh. As he grew older, George followed in his father’s footsteps and began working for Miami as a janitor, while his brother Francis became a kitchen helper and his sister Josephine a dishwasher.\n \nGeorge became enrolled at Miami in the fall of 1925. He obtained his B.S. in Education in the 1930 before pursuing a Master’s in Education beginning in 1931. During his time as a student, George was initiated into Omega Psi Phi, a historically African American fraternity founded at Howard University in 1911, the first fraternity to be founded at an HBCU. He was also a founding member of Kappa Sigma Delta, organized in 1929 as the first known African American student organization on campus. Tanner served as the lead representative of Kappa Sigma Delta in an unsuccessful petition to the Administrative Council for the organization to be recognized as an official fraternity in 1932— it would take another six years of operating as an unofficial student organization for Kappa Sigma Delta to be recognized by Miami under the name “The Colored Students Club” in 1938. It was at Miami that he met fellow student and Kappa Sigma Delta member Lucetta Spurlock, class of 1928, whom he married in 1930. In the following years, the couple would move to Dayton, Ohio and give birth to their two sons, Theodore and Troy.\n\nAfter leaving Miami, George began to work as a public school teacher in Dayton, where he worked for thirty-seven years. He married his second wife, Nancy Harris, in 1956. George served as Master of the Ancient Square Free and Accepted Masons Lodge in Dayton and was a former 32nd degree Mason and Shriner— one of the most prestigious degrees a Freemason can achieve, reserved for Master Masons. He was a member of the Ohio Retired Teachers Association, an organization called the Association of Ohio Teachers of Slow Learning Children, and the Trinity United Presbyterian Church.\n\nGeorge passed away on March 15th, 1975 at the age of seventy.","citations":"Ancestry.com. 1910 United States Federal Census [database on-line].

She was born in San Nicolas in Ilocos Norte, Philippines on August 6th, 1896— two years before the United States established military rule in the Philippines and six years before the islands became an unincorporated U.S. territory— to parents Epifaño Cabanos and Micaela Fernandez Cabanos. Alberta attended the Philippine Normal School in Manila, graduating in 1918 before becoming a public school teacher in Manila. In the summer of 1920, she applied for a passport to study abroad in the United States, aiming to obtain her Bachelors of Science in teaching at Miami University. She departed from Manila in August of 1920, sailing on the *U.S.S. Tenyo Maru* with a group of Filipino students who were similarly enrolled in American institutions, many of which were sponsored by government aid. One of the other passengers, Mauro Fonacier, a twenty-five year old man from Claveria, Philippines who was to begin school at the University of Pennsylvania that fall, would later become her husband.\n\nAlberta, considered to be sophomore standing due to her prior studies at the Philippine Normal School, was one of three Filipina students attending Miami University when she arrived in Oxford that fall. Caridad Trillo, a sophomore from the city of ​​Butuan in the Agusan del Norte province, and Catalina Occeña, a freshman from the city of San Remigio in the Cebu province, were also enrolled at the university. Alberta was likely a “pensionado”—  the recipient of a scholarship awarded by the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands to Filipino students who wished to study in the United States. During her time in Oxford, she advocated for the independence of the Philippines to her American peers, writing articles in *The Miami Student* pushing for Filipino autonomy. She graduated from Miami in 1923 before going on to obtain her Master of Arts in Education at Columbia University, again sponsored by the pensionado program.\n\nAfter graduation, Alberta returned to the Philippines in the fall of 1923, where she taught geography at the Philippine Normal School in Manila before becoming the supervisor of teacher-training at the Ilocos Norte Normal School. She returned to the United States in 1929 to join Mauro, who was attending Loyola University Chicago in pursuit of his Doctorate in Medicine. Mauro graduated in 1929, and the couple married on June 16th, 1930. They gave birth to their son, Mauro Cabanos Fonacier, in 1932. Not much is known about their life after that.\n\nAlberta passed away in February of 1990 at the age of 93 years old.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *California, U.S., Arriving Passenger and Crew Lists, 1882-1959* [database on-line].

She was born on February 20th, 1921 to parents Arthur Hammond Hargraves and Anna Langford Hargraves in Oxford, Ohio, where her parents were employed by the university as a janitor and cook, respectively. Her two brothers, William and Langford, attended Miami in the 1920s, with William becoming one the first two African American students to earn a four-year bachelor’s degree from the school in 1925. Edythe graduated from Stewart High School in Oxford before enrolling at Miami University as an Education major in the fall of 1939.\n\nDuring her time at Miami, Edythe was a member of Le Travailleurs, the first known African American student organization on campus. First organized in 1929 under the name Kappa Sigma Delta, the club had unsuccessfully petitioned to be recognized as an official fraternity in 1932. It would take another six years of operating as an unofficial student organization for Kappa Sigma Delta to be recognized by Miami under the name “The Colored Students Club” in 1938, changing its name back to Kappa Sigma Delta and then Le Travailleurs shortly thereafter. Edythe was also selected for membership in Kappa Delta Pi, a national education honorary, and the Liberal Arts-Alethenai, an English honorary for women.\n\nIn 1942, she wrote an essay titled “How I Feel as a Negro at a White College,” which was then published by *The Journal of Negro Education*, a peer-reviewed academic journal published by Howard University. In the essay, Edythe spoke to the discrimination and prejudice she has faced while a student at Miami. She recalled how she and other Black students were excluded from membership in sororities, called racial slurs by their white classmates, and experienced both social alienation and what she called “a keen sense of inferiority” during their courses. However, despite the many struggles she faced attending a predominantly white institution, she asserted the importance of perseverance, fortitude, and tolerance in making the most of her education. “I would be a fool to let these immature white students ruin my chance for a college education,” she wrote. “I must go on.” And go on she did— Edythe graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education with a focus on English in the spring of 1943.\n\nFollowing her graduation from Miami, Edythe began working as a secretary at Wilbur Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson Air Force Base), where she remained during the World War II years. She then returned to Miami in 1945 to work as a secretary for the university in the Department of Home Economics and Division of Secondary Education. According to family accounts, she was the first African American to be professionally hired by Miami. A leader in the Oxford community, Edythe served as secretary of the local branch of the NAACP and was a member of the American Association of University Women. She was active in both the Bethel A.M.E. Church and the Fortnightly Club, a women’s group that helped fundraise for annual scholarships awarded to local African American high school seniors, providing them with financial aid to attend college upon their graduation.\n\nEdythe Hargrave Turner passed away on March 11th, 1947 at the age of twenty-five after a period of illness. She is buried in Woodside Cemetery.\n\n*Note: Unlike other Hargraves family members, Edythe appears to have dropped the “s” from her last name in all documentation, going by Hargrave. This is the spelling that will be used for this biography.*\n","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1920 United States Federal Census* [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010.

Eleanor obtained her associate degree from Ohio University before enrolling at Miami University in the fall of 1921. Reece graduated in the spring of 1925 with a Bachelor of Science in Education, demonstrating great academic success in the face of adversity and paving the way for generations of Black Miami students to come.\n\nFollowing her graduation from Miami, Eleanor moved to St. Louis, Missouri to work as a public school teacher. She returned to Ohio shortly thereafter to begin her career in Cincinnati Public Schools. Reece was a member of the Payne A.M.E.

She was born to parents David “Lucius” and Addie Warren on September 15th, 1903 in Decatur, Alabama, where she spent the first nine months of her life before the Warrens moved to Oxford, Ohio in search of greater job and educational opportunities. Lucius, a plasterer by trade, had two brothers already employed by Miami— his brother Arthur worked as a janitor while his brother Roy was a cook— who arranged for him and Addie to start working as a plasterer and housekeeper, respectively, upon their arrival. They joined several other relatives working for the university, including Arthur’s wife Emma Rile Warren, Roy’s children Jeanette and Robert, and his third brother Carl’s son, Spencer.\n\nAlamay began demonstrating her musical talents at an early age, starting piano lessons at age five and playing piano for the Elm Street Christian Church by the age of nine. She graduated from Oxford Public School in the spring of 1922 before enrolling in the Teachers College that fall. Although Alamay spent two years at Miami completing the Teachers College program, she was not able to gain teaching experience because the schools in and around Oxford did not allow Black student teachers to practice their lesson plans— she instead had to sit back and observe her white classmates deliver their lessons to local classrooms. In 1926, she began working in the university dining halls, where her strong work ethic quickly earned her a promotion to dining room manager. At the same time, Alamay began performing piano accompaniments for local musical ensembles and vocalists in concerts around the area. She married Elmer Thorpe Finnell, a cook for the university and professional trombone player, in 1927. The couple would often play their instruments together during services at the Bethel A.M.E. Church in Oxford. They gave birth to a son, Elmer Jr., in 1928, and remained together for twenty six years until Elmer Sr. passed away in 1953.\n\nAlamay continued to work for Miami, eventually promoted to Supervisor of Catering at the University Center— the position she would retire from in 1963. She married Earl Monroe Thrasher, who was employed as a janitor at Miami, around 1955. Following her retirement, Alamay became involved in a number of community organizations, including as a member of the Oxford Music Club, board member for United Way, president of the Oxford Federation of Clubs, and judge for the Board of Elections. She also became a member of Oxford Senior Citizens, Inc., where she served both as committee chairman and as a member of the Board of Trustees. It was through her involvement with Oxford Senior Citizens that she would be chosen from hundreds of applicants as a delegate to the White House Conference on Aging in 1981. As a member of Oxford’s Fortnightly Club, she helped raise funds for annual scholarships awarded to local African American high school seniors, providing them with financial aid to attend college upon their graduation. Alamay volunteered at McCullough-Hyde Memorial Hospital and frequently visited area nursing homes to share her piano talents with the residents. She was nominated for Citizen of the Year in 1973, and in 1979, Alamay was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal in recognition of her extraordinary contributions to the Oxford community. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president.\n \nAlamay Warren Thrasher passed away on July 4th, 1994 at the age of ninety and is buried in Woodside Cemetery. In a 1981 oral history interview with the Scripps Gerontology Center, when asked how she would like to be remembered, she responded with the following:\n“Just as a person about town with lots of friends and interested in what is going on and what— any contribution that I have made in any field— I would like to think that somebody will remember me. Not to compliment me, but just to say, ‘Well, she liked it, she was a part of it.’ This is what I would like.”","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1910 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

She was born April 17th, 1914 in Muncie, Indiana to parents Harry Lewis and Viola Herd Lewis. Evelyn and her family moved to Kenton, Ohio at an early age, where her father worked as a shoe shiner. She attended Kenton High School, serving on the student council and graduating in 1931.\n\nEvelyn enrolled at Miami University that fall, pursuing a degree in education with an emphasis in English. During her time as a student, she was active in the Y.W.C.A. and held various leadership positions in the organization, including being elected to the cabinet and serving as religious council. Evelyn was a student athlete, playing for both the women’s field hockey team and women’s soccer team, as well as being a member of the Women’s Athletic Association. Though Miami did not have a chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha— the first intercollegiate, historically African American sorority— while she was a student, there was an Ivy Leaf Pledge Club on campus beginning in 1931, allowing Miami women interested in joining AKA to become candidates for initiation in surrounding undergraduate chapters. Many of these women, including Evelyn, were initiated into AKA through the nearby Omicron chapter at the University of Cincinnati. She and the other Miami AKAs were therefore considered “Stray Greeks”, as they belonged to a group of students whose fraternity or sorority were not represented on Miami’s campus. Miami would eventually charter its own chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha in 1977. Evelyn graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Education in the spring of 1935.\n\nAfter graduation, Evelyn began working for the office of the Ohio Secretary of State in Columbus. It was during her time in Columbus that she met her future husband, Kenneth L. Johnson, who had recently graduated from Wilberforce University— a historically African American university in Xenia, Ohio and the first in the nation to be Black-owned and operated— and was working for the Columbus Y.M.C.A. as a program manager. Evelyn moved to Xenia to work as a secretary for Wilberforce before she and Kenneth wed in 1941. Following Kenneth’s service in Europe during World War II, the couple moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where Kenneth began working at the historically black university Arkansas AM\u0026N College (now University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) as the Director of Athletics and Chairman of the Department of Health, Physical Education and Recreation. Evelyn would join the faculty a few years later working in the English department. She earned her Masters of English from Boston University and continued working for Arkansas AM\u0026N until she retired in 1984. Kenneth and Evelyn had two children together, Kenneth Jr. and Marilyn Elaine.\n\nA member of the National Association of University Women, the Altar of Rosary Society of St. Peter Catholic Church, and the Board of Trustees of the Arts and Sciences Center for Southeast Arkansas, Evelyn continued to serve the Pine Bluff community through her civic involvement throughout her life. She also remained active in Alpha Kappa Alpha— in 1947, she, along with a group of local AKA women, got together to begin organizing the charter of a graduate chapter in Pine Bluff. The Delta Omega Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha was chartered in the fall of 1948 with Evelyn as a founding member. She earned the distinction of Diamond Soror in 2006, a title given to individuals who have been an active member of AKA for seventy five years.\n \nEvelyn passed away on December 9th, 2011 at the age of ninety-seven. At the time of her death, she had been a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha for eighty years.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1920 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

Born on April 21st, 1921 in Kapehu, Hawaii to parents Shinichi Saito and Onao Kurisu Saito, he grew up in North Hilo, Hawaii where both of his parents worked at a sugar cane plantation. Saito graduated from Hilo High School in 1939, spending a year working in the county clerk’s office before enrolling at Miami as a Liberal Arts major on a pre-law track in the fall of 1940.\n\nDuring his time at Miami, Herbert was involved in a number of student organizations. He served as president of the Cosmopolitan Club— an international club that welcomed students of diverse backgrounds— and was a member of the Speakers Bureau, the Association of Miami Independents, Tau Kappa Alpha fraternity, and Les Politiques, a club for those interested in political science. Selected to participate in the Fisk Public Speaking Contest all three years he attended Miami, he placed third his freshman and sophomore years and second his senior year. Several of his speeches focused on his experiences growing up in the then-Hawaii Territory— in addition to public speaking opportunities, he also vocalized his support for Hawaiian statehood in publications like *The Miami Student*. When U.S. involvement in World War II created an increased need for Japanese translators, Saito volunteered to teach a non-credit Japanese course to assist his peers in learning the language. He taught the course for two years. He was one of many Miami students during the war years who, as part of a larger project conducted by history professor Dr. William E. Smith, documented both their daily campus lives and perceptions of the war through diary entries. Herbert graduated in the spring of 1943 and enlisted in the military that July, where he served as a linguist in the U.S. Army Air Force.\n\nFollowing his return from war, Saito began teaching back home on Hilo, first at Kohala High School and then at Konawaena High School, where he would eventually retire from. An English teacher, he served as an advisor to a number of different extracurricular clubs, including the Kona Junior Rifle Club and the Kona Junior Young Buddhist Association. He married Ayoka “Ethel” Imai in 1950— the couple had three daughters together, Gloria, Darlene, and Jeanne. Herbert remained active in the Hilo community throughout his life, serving as a Sunday school teacher at his Honwanji Buddhist temple, commander of Post 20 of the American Legion, and secretary for the Kona Invitational Softball League.\n\nHerbert Saito passed away on June 12th, 1993 at the age of seventy-two.

He was born on February 5th, 1902 to parents Hammond Arthur Hargraves and Anna Langford Hargraves in Barnesville, Ohio, where Hammond worked as a hotel porter. William attended grade school in Gila, Arizona before the family moved to Oxford, Ohio in 1911, where both of William’s parents began working for the university— Anna as a cook and Hammond as a janitor. After graduating from Oxford High School, he enrolled at Miami in the fall of 1921, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree.\n \nWilliam was the first of his three siblings to attend the university. His brother, Langford, enrolled at Miami in 1924, finishing his degree at Wilberforce University— a historically African American university in Xenia, Ohio and the first in the nation to be Black-owned and operated— in 1932. His sister, Edythe, graduated from Miami with an education degree in 1943. Both of his siblings went on to have careers at Miami— Langford worked as a pool technician in the campus athletic facilities, while Edythe worked as a secretary in the Department of Home Economics and Division of Secondary Education until her passing in 1947. According to family accounts, she was the first African-American to be professionally hired by the university. William graduated from Miami in the spring of 1925, demonstrating great academic success in the face of adversity and paving the way for generations of Black Miami students to come.\n\nIn 1929, Hargraves began his career as a social studies teacher at the Lincoln-Grant School in Covington, Kentucky, a segregated public K-12 school building for African American students consisting of both an elementary school (Lincoln School) and high school (William Grant High School). During his first year living in Covington, he and another teacher stayed in the home of Lincoln-Grant’s principal, Henry R. Merry. William married Annie Leona Thomas, who also taught at the Lincoln-Grant School, in June of 1930 in Lorain, Ohio. The couple had two children together, William II and Beatrice. Hargraves earned his Master of Arts degree from Miami in 1936. While living in Oxford, he was a member of the Bethel A.M.E. Church— he transferred his membership to the St. James A.M.E. Church when he moved to Covington, where he served both as a trustee and as superintendent of their Sunday school.\n\nWilliam Hargraves I passed away on December 12th, 1953 at the age of fifty-one and is buried in Woodside Cemetery.","citations":"Ancestry.com. *1900 United States Federal Census* [database on-line].

Born in Alabama in 1910, Louise and her family originally from Alabama moved to Lemon Township, just south of Middletown, Ohio during the 1920’s. Her father Bishop Clark, born in Alabama, was a rolling mill steel worker. The family’s movement to Ohio contributed to the Great Migration of African Americans from the south to industrial towns in the north seeking opportunity. Louise pursues her own path, following the movement of her family to Ohio, she decided to get a college education.\n\nIn 1928, Black students were not allowed to live in the dorms. Louise lived with African American families during her time as a student at Miami. She lived with the “vegetable lady” from the girls' dining hall who offered her twenty five cents an hour for up to five hours a week to pare vegetables. This is how Louise earned her spending money. When Louise lived with Mr. and Mrs. Byrd on Oak Street was still under the same rules as if she were a student living in the dorms. Before she could leave the house, she had to record where she was going and when she would return on a sign in sheet, however Louise shared that the girls usually wrote the library even when that was not where they were going. This sheet would be delivered to Dean Hamilton at the end of each week. The girls feared if they were ever late they would risk being kicked out of Miami. Louise and the other girls living with the Byrd’s paid the same room and board as the on campus students. These girls would stay there most of the year, only leaving for the summer and Christmas break. They stayed in Oxford for Thanksgiving, African American students would come together at someone's home and the parents would make dinner. Louise spent six weeks of her studies living away from Miami University to complete her student teaching. Miami spent one hundred dollars for African American students to complete their student teaching at Xenia, a Black highschool. She stayed here for six weeks to complete her student teaching requirement.\n\nAn exceptionally active participant during her time as a student, Louise was president of the Ivy League Club. She was a club member of the Y.W.C.A, which defined itself as united in the desire to realize a full and creative life through a growing knowledge of God. She was also a member of the Mathematics Club. Eva Clark Mitchell, the sister of Louise, claimed Louise was a mathematical and computer type, making it no surprise she ended up in the university's Mathematics Club. The Mathematics Club was open to all students and faculty who wanted to come together and consider mathematical topics outside of scheduled courses, twice a month.\n\nMost importantly, she was a lifelong member of the first intercollegiate historically-African American sorority, founded in 1908,  Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA). She remained dedicated to Alpha Kappa Alpha for the duration of her life. During much of her time at Miami she was a dedicated member to Miami University’s women's sports teams. Despite being nervous to try out for athletics due to fear of being left out, she decided to try out. She was a member of Varsity Soccer, Hockey, Volleyball, Basketball, Baseball, and Track during her four years at Miami. With each team a student made, they were awarded points to wear on the pocket of their sweater, she had 32. The goal was to gain enough points to earn an M, which she did.\n\nAfter graduating from Miami University, Louise became a prominent educator and administrator. At Dayton’s Dunbar High School, a historically African American high school, she taught math for seventeen years. Louise shared that Miami recognized her as a good teacher and sent twelve white students to do student teaching in her classroom at Dunbar. Dr. Christofferson, her mentor, who had recommended her for student teaching suggested she return to Miami to complete her master’s degree. Her masters project was called, *What Are The Relationships, If Any, Between Social And Economic Backgrounds And School Achievement*. Her thesis professor was Dr. Edmiston. Her goal was to see if kids with the most money received the best grades; she tested this theory on one hundred and fifty ninth graders at Dayton Dunbar High School. After that, she served as Principal of Booker T. Washington School in Middletown. She taught math at MHS in her final years before retiring in 1980. She was a lifelong active member of Delta Kappa Gamma (KΣΔ), a professional educator organization for women founded in 1929, and remained an active member the rest of her life. Louise married Herbert McBain on December 20, 1941. Herbert was the maintenance superintendent of the grounds in Middletown Regional Hospital. They had one daughter named Zee Whitetaker, and two grandsons. On September 17, 1989 Louise passed away at the age of seventy nine after an extended battle with cancer. In 1989 Louise was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of her extraordinary career as a student and educator. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president. Louise Clark McBain embraced the life of being a Miami student and her long career in education meant she graced hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other students with her guidance and wisdom.","citations":"“AKA,”Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated, https://aka1908.com/.\n\n“DKG,” Delta Kappa Gamma - Leading Women Educators Impacting Education\n Worldwide,’ https://www.dkg.org/.\n\n“Bishop Medal,” Miami Alum, Miami University, 2022,\n https://www.miamialum.org/s/916/16/interior.aspx?pgid=8098\u0026gid=1.\n\n\"Black Reunion Record Miami University,\" *Miami University Black Alumni Reunion*, pp. 3, 4, 5, 6.\n\nJim Calhoun, “Louise Clark McBain, teacher,” Obituary, *The Cincinnati Enquirer*, 9/22/1989, Newspapers.com, https://www.newspapers.com/clip/68261254/obituary-for-louise-clark-\nmcbain-aged/, 6/1/2022.\n\nMiami University, *Miami University Alumni Directory*, 1932 (Oxford, Ohio), 182.\n\nMiami University, *Miami University Directory* (Oxford, Ohio: Publisher, 1931-1932), 19.\n\nMiami University, *Recensio 1932* (Oxford, Ohio: 1932) pp. 34, 219, Miami University Archives, accessed on June 2, 2022, \t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://digital.lib.miamioh.edu/digital/collection/p17240coll2/id/24663/rec/32.\n\nMiami University, *Miami University M-Books 1932-1933* (Oxford, Ohio).\n\nUnited States of America, Bureau of the Census; Washington, D.C.; *Seventeenth Census of the United States, 1950*; Record Group: Records of the Bureau of the Census, 1790-2007; Record Group Number: 29; Residence Date: 1950; Home in 1950: Middletown, Butler, Ohio; Roll: 3695; Enumeration District: 9-51.\n\n\"U.S., School Yearbooks, 1880-2012\"; School Name: Middletown High School; Year: 1959.","decades":["1920s","1930s"],"featured":[{"_key":"ac1d75957d4a","_ref":"d724fc32-0902-4c1b-882e-98726065881f","_type":"reference"}],"localSubjects":[{"_key":"1c409070c1b1","_ref":"27f6c558-fcec-4588-bbef-87bca7ff5c23","_type":"reference"},{"_key":"6db2478e64de","_ref":"da09cf4d-8384-4da2-adb3-9e32bdc9c7e3","_type":"reference"}],"publishedAt":"2022-08-01","slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"louise-clark-mcbain"},"storyMetadata":{"_type":"storyMetadata","storyEntered":"2022-12-20T01:46:56.468Z"},"storyType":"Biography","theme":[{"_key":"5fd063763f7f","_ref":"ef2bf682-0829-488f-b6b1-a73bd4547c28","_type":"reference"},{"_key":"93b0182e0c90","_ref":"2e278615-583c-4cc2-a7a3-ce55d053028c","_type":"reference"},{"_key":"d7cbf218ca75","_ref":"5999ea8d-410b-4295-beb1-2a403257d2dc","_type":"reference"},{"_key":"f2c67f67c44a","_ref":"b4da3cb4-a124-4c6a-a9f5-5563ea5556b5","_type":"reference"}],"title":"Louise Clark McBain"},{"_createdAt":"2023-01-20T21:04:42Z","_id":"ed1c6784-7469-4624-b622-4fe5ad8d3ca3","_rev":"5LcYQDxXHQkCUNgfyfxPR4","_type":"kaltura","_updatedAt":"2023-02-13T19:59:18Z","kalturaEmbedCode":"\u003cscript src=\"https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/886232/sp/88623200/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/21440252/partner_id/886232\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e \u003cdiv id=\"kaltura_player_1676318242\" style=\"width: 528px; height: 327px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cscript\u003e kWidget.embed({   \"targetId\": \"kaltura_player_1676318242\",   \"wid\": \"_886232\",   \"uiconf_id\": 21440252,   \"flashvars\": {},   \"cache_st\": 1676318242,   \"entry_id\": \"1_2826ht4k\" }); \u003c/script\u003e","kalturaId":"1_2826ht4k","kalturaTitle":"LivedMU_RowanHall_2022-06-11_FINAL"},{"_createdAt":"2022-12-19T17:47:30Z","_id":"ed9a2b4c-7720-4118-81f0-27ce24b9dfb7","_rev":"g3eVvcaWGlJGpezIxj1X6m","_type":"person","_updatedAt":"2023-01-18T14:06:58Z","demographicInformation":{"_type":"demographics","gender":"Male","race":["Black/African American"]},"mainImage":{"_type":"mainImage","asset":{"_ref":"image-4ad9c2dd14508407bcf18d829a320f0b9cfb30a2-495x700-jpg","_type":"reference"}},"miamiInformation":{"_type":"miamiProfile","miamiEducation":[{"_key":"097aed62313b","_type":"miamiEducation","degree":"B.S.","educationInstitution":"Miami University","graduationYear":"1968-01-01","major":[{"_key":"5f93836604bd","_ref":"9af97484-c597-4a17-ab0a-e1bd44ed96c5","_type":"reference"}]}],"status":["Student"]},"name":"Theodore Eugene Downing","personType":["Story Subject"],"personalNames":{"_type":"personName","firstName":"Theodore","lastName":"Downing","middleName":"Eugene","preferredName":"Ted Downing"},"slug":{"_type":"slug","current":"theodore-eugene-downing"}},{"_createdAt":"2023-01-13T06:06:01Z","_id":"eed422ce-4083-45c2-b38c-9c3a3eedadf9","_rev":"R1lQVXW7BqCA6PpJmwLWni","_type":"person","_updatedAt":"2023-01-20T21:14:22Z","bio":"Donna Ginn studied both Psychology and Zoology at Miami University.

After visiting campus she was excited to start her education. When Myldred entered Miami University in 1945 she was the first in her family to attend college. She graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology. Myldred was a great driving force for needed change, on campus and off. Through her bravery and refusal to accept unacceptable treatment, Myldred used her voice to instill change.\n \nMyldred was one of the first two female African American students to live on campus. When Myldred arrived on Move in Day in 1945, she was very disappointed. The room she was assigned was not only in appalling conditions, it was in the basement, next to the furnace room. In a 2006 interview Myldred recalled, “ that wasn’t going to be where I would be living,”. Myldred invited the Dean of Women to see the dorm room herself. When she arrived, Myldred asked the Dean if she would live there, her response was no and Myldred said “and so was mine.” For the rest of her first year, Myldred lived with Mr. and Mrs. Jackson, an African American family living on Vine Street in Oxford. At the time many African American students lived with local African American families so they could attend the university.\n \nHer sophomore year, Myldred lived at the Tallawanda Apartments. The transition back onto campus would prove to create new challenges for Myldred. Miami University reached out to the parents of the other students living at the Tallawanda Apartments to ask them if they knew an African American woman would be living on the first floor. All of the students living on the first floor with Myldred were women whose parents consented. Myldred recounted that she had met the women who would become her roommates in class and they got along. Myldred’s dorm included herself and five other women. The Tallawanda Apartment building housed two hundred women across three floors. Myldred proved that the dorms could successfully integrate.\n \nOn campus and uptown proved to be problematic for the African American community. Myldred recalled, “The people in the town who wanted to buy sandwiches would be served from the rear of that establishment,” she said. “You’d have to go to the back of the establishment and get your brown paper bag … and I just couldn’t do that.”. The racial discrimination Myldred experienced inspired her to join the Campus Interracial Club where she held the position of corresponding secretary. The club did not feel welcomed on campus so instead the students sought off campus options for club meetings and social events. Myldred shared that, “the people in the town opened their homes to us so I have a strong affinity for them”. The Campus Interracial Club provided a social space for African American students to get the support they needed and feel heard. During Myldred’s time as a student, she saw change in the uptown restaurants.  Myldred said, “Those who were serving us at first didn’t serve us,” she said. “But we sat and sat, and we changed positions and others would come and sit, and all of a sudden at some point in time, we could walk in and be seated and were served.”\n\nAfter graduating from Miami University in 1949, Myldred completed a Masters of Library and Information Science from Case Western Reserve University in 1957. For ten years, Myldred taught elementary school in Cleveland, Ohio. She shifted careers when she started working in real estate sales in 1961. She continued in this field, eventually becoming the owner of her own reality company. In the 1980’s Myldred’s daughter attended Miami University, studying language and joining the Black Student Action Association. Myldred has visited Miami University multiple times during her life and has especially enjoyed visiting the homes of the families who welcomed her and The Campus Interracial Club during her years as a Miami student. In 2005 the Pioneer Award was established to recognize those who have broken new ground and prepared the way for other African American Students. Myldred Boston Howell exemplified these accomplishments through her tenacity and determination to receive fair treatment.

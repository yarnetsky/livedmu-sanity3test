        <h2 class="fs-1">Curator's Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Over 10,000 pages of archival material were digitized for the <i>Lived Experiences: Race at Miami
                University</i>
            project. The new <a href="https://cdm17240.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/race/search">Race at Miami
                University Digital Collection</a> is related to an ongoing series of video
            interviews with Black alumni, faculty and staff of Miami University. Those interviews reveal real-life
            experiences
            of race at Miami University. Lived experience is partly structured by the institutionâ€™s rules, regulations,
            courses
            and instruction; employment and benefits; and ongoing debates, discussions, and decisions regarding life at
            the
            University. Like all American universities, Miami both reflects and shapes the ways race affects the lives
            of those
            taking classes, those teaching classes, and those who are employees. This collection is a sample of the
            history of
            trailblazers and heroes, of challenges and disappointments, of individual choices and structured realities.
            It
            works in concert with the real-life experiences revealed in the interviews conducted since the summer of
            2022.

            <h3><i>Lived experiences</i> in the Archives</h3>
            <p>Every document in the <a href="https://cdm17240.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/race/search">Race
                    at Miami
                    Digital Collection</a> represents a story about someone's actual experience,
                whether as an administrator, faculty member, employee or student. Each document was selected because it
                both
                reveals those individual stories and because it addresses a larger, broader story of the history of
                Miami
                University. You can learn about day-to-day tasks of the African American janitorial staff in 1923 or the
                challenges faced by President Shriver and Vice President Robert Etheridge after the student uprising of
                1970. You can read the thoughtful, sophisticated analyses offered by members of the Black Student Action
                Association (BSAA) not only during that uprising but for decades afterwards. You can read about male
                students from Thailand in the 1930s, the surprising outcome of Miami Class of 1908 member Murray
                Sheehan's
                work for the Royal Embassy. Each document is a small part of the holdings in
                <a href="http://archivesspace.lib.miamioh.edu/">Miami University Archives</a>.
                President Shriver's papers, for example, fill 237 archival boxes &mdash; 115 of them are office files
                alone! You
                can rely on the digitized documents found here to better understand the experiences of Miami University,
                and
                to continue your further research you can visit the Miami University Archives.

    <p>For a history about the relationship between American higher education and race see Craig Steven Wilder's
        <i>Ebony and Ivy</i> (2013) from Bloomsbury Press.
    </p>
    <p>For more about the history of Miami University, <i>Miami University 1809-2009: Bicentennial Perspectives</i>
        (2009),
        edited by Curtis Ellison, is the comprehensive history of Miami, and includes excellent sections on race at
        Miami.
    </p>
    <p>To learn about the history of the Myaamiaki, the Native American nation with which Miami University shares a
        name and has a formal educational relationship, the website of the <a href="https://www.miamination.com/">
            Miami Tribe of Oklahoma</a> is a great place to
        start, as is the <a href="https://www.miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/index.html">
            Myaamia Center</a>'s website.
    </p>
    <p>
        This selected collection on race at Miami's Oxford Campus is not intended to systematically include
        materials related to Native Americans or the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma; or to Jewish students, faculty and
        staff; to disability history; or to the history of women at Miami. Hopefully selected digitized collections
        about these important topics will be available in the future.

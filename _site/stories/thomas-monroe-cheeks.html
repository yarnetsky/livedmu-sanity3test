                        <p>Thomas Monroe Cheeks attended Miami University from 1925 to 1929, pursuing a Bachelor’s in Education. Born June 15, 1907, to Sidney Cheeks and Mary Alice Bruner Cheeks, Thomas was raised in Oxford, Ohio. Thomas grew up near campus at 208 University Avenue. Thomas was the youngest of seven children. He attended Oxford Public School from first grade through high school. When asked in a July 19th, 1988 interview about what made him decide to go to Miami, Thomas said he decided to attend Miami when the four-year program of physical education, athletic coaching, and athletic directorship was created in May 1925.</p>

<p>In the same 1988 interview, Thomas discussed the coaching program describing the curriculum as challenging and requiring the completion of 132 credit hours to graduate. To complete his degree in time Thomas took eighteen credit hours all four years of his education. To fulfill his required practice teaching assignment, Thomas went to East high school in Xenia, Ohio. He spent nine weeks teaching while living with his sister, Ethel who lived near the high school. Thomas was also an active member of Omega Psi Phi, a historically African American fraternity founded in 1911.</p>

<p>When Thomas Cheeks started at Miami University Mr. Roudebush ensured he received a job as a janitor according to the 1988 interview. Thomas was paid forty cents an hour to work. He was responsible for two buildings, Benton Hall and Brice Hall. Thomas worked two hours each weekday and eight hours on Saturday. His father, Sidney Cheeks worked full time as a janitor at Miami University and helped Thomas look after his buildings in addition to his own work. In a 1988 interview, Thomas shared he had his tuition waived since his father worked at Miami.</p>

<p>After graduating from Miami in 1929 Thomas continued his education as a graduate student at Indiana University. He and his wife Diana B. settled in Indiana where Thomas held a coaching position at Lincoln High School. Thomas stayed at the school for twenty years working as both a coach and a teacher. In January of 1964 a teaching opportunity led Thomas to move to Milwaukee where he continued his teaching career and was the chairman of the social studies department. In 1976 Thomas Cheeks was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of his extraordinary career as an educator and coach. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president.</p>

<p>Thomas’ story starts with his father’s experience, when Sidney Cheeks and his parents and siblings left West Virginia to escape the aftermath of the War. Born October 26, 1866, Sidney was an infant when his family settled in Oxford, Ohio. Sidney met Mary Bruner in Oxford and they were married on October 10, 1888. Mary Bruner was born October 1868 and passed away November 11, 1946. Sidney ran a dairy farm in addition to his thirty-year career as a janitor at Miami University. Sidney passed away at the age of seventy-two on March 19, 1938.</p>

<p>Sidney and Mary had seven children; Stanley, Robert, Ethel, Ruth, Mable, Carrie, and Thomas. Stanley Cheeks stayed in Oxford, Ohio his whole life, according to a 1981 interview with his brother Robert Cheeks. Robert , born April 25, 1895 shared in a 1981 interview that he did not attend Miami University because at the time Miami was not accepting African American students. Robert worked as a general contractor, farmer, florist, and trader. In the 1981 interview he stated that he owned and built multiple buildings in Oxford, Ohio as a way to provide for his family. Robert married Loretta Poston and had two children, James Cheeks and Isabelle Cheeks, who both graduated from Miami University. Carrie Cheeks Morgan, the second youngest Cheeks sibling, also attended Miami University. Born July 4th, 1904, she attended a two-year education school at Miami University. After graduating she moved to Chicago to start her career in office work but returned to Oxford with her husband Charles Morgan after her mother passed.</p>

<p>The maternal grandfather of the seven siblings was Peter Bruner. Peter Bruner was born into slavery in Kentucky. He was separated from his family to work as a tanner. During the Civil War, he escaped slavery to join the Union Army at Camp Nelson. After the war, he settled in Oxford, Ohio as a free man. Peter worked as a custodian and messenger at Miami University, Western Female Seminary, and Oxford College. He was the first African American man to work at Miami University. Peter, with the help of this family, preserved his memories in an autobiography, <em>A Slave’s Adventures Toward Freedom</em>. Peter passed away on April 6, 1938. Many of Peter Bruner’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren graduated from Miami University including Carrie Cheeks Morgan, Isabel Cheeks Lewis, Thomas Kelly, Margaret Greene McClain, James Cheeks, and Thomas Monroe Cheeks.</p>

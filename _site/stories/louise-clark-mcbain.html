                        <p>Louise Clark McBain began her academic journey at Miami University in 1928, she graduated in 1932 with a BS in Education, and returned to complete a graduate degree in 1944. Born in Alabama in 1910, Louise and her family originally from Alabama moved to Lemon Township, just south of Middletown, Ohio during the 1920’s. Her father Bishop Clark, born in Alabama, was a rolling mill steel worker. The family’s movement to Ohio contributed to the Great Migration of African Americans from the south to industrial towns in the north seeking opportunity. Louise pursues her own path, following the movement of her family to Ohio, she decided to get a college education.</p>

<p>In 1928, Black students were not allowed to live in the dorms. Louise lived with African American families during her time as a student at Miami. She lived with the “vegetable lady” from the girls’ dining hall who offered her twenty five cents an hour for up to five hours a week to pare vegetables. This is how Louise earned her spending money. When Louise lived with Mr. and Mrs. Byrd on Oak Street was still under the same rules as if she were a student living in the dorms. Before she could leave the house, she had to record where she was going and when she would return on a sign in sheet, however Louise shared that the girls usually wrote the library even when that was not where they were going. This sheet would be delivered to Dean Hamilton at the end of each week. The girls feared if they were ever late they would risk being kicked out of Miami. Louise and the other girls living with the Byrd’s paid the same room and board as the on campus students. These girls would stay there most of the year, only leaving for the summer and Christmas break. They stayed in Oxford for Thanksgiving, African American students would come together at someone’s home and the parents would make dinner. Louise spent six weeks of her studies living away from Miami University to complete her student teaching. Miami spent one hundred dollars for African American students to complete their student teaching at Xenia, a Black highschool. She stayed here for six weeks to complete her student teaching requirement.</p>

<p>An exceptionally active participant during her time as a student, Louise was president of the Ivy League Club. She was a club member of the Y.W.C.A, which defined itself as united in the desire to realize a full and creative life through a growing knowledge of God. She was also a member of the Mathematics Club. Eva Clark Mitchell, the sister of Louise, claimed Louise was a mathematical and computer type, making it no surprise she ended up in the university’s Mathematics Club. The Mathematics Club was open to all students and faculty who wanted to come together and consider mathematical topics outside of scheduled courses, twice a month.</p>

<p>Most importantly, she was a lifelong member of the first intercollegiate historically-African American sorority, founded in 1908,  Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA). She remained dedicated to Alpha Kappa Alpha for the duration of her life. During much of her time at Miami she was a dedicated member to Miami University’s women’s sports teams. Despite being nervous to try out for athletics due to fear of being left out, she decided to try out. She was a member of Varsity Soccer, Hockey, Volleyball, Basketball, Baseball, and Track during her four years at Miami. With each team a student made, they were awarded points to wear on the pocket of their sweater, she had 32. The goal was to gain enough points to earn an M, which she did.</p>

<p>After graduating from Miami University, Louise became a prominent educator and administrator. At Dayton’s Dunbar High School, a historically African American high school, she taught math for seventeen years. Louise shared that Miami recognized her as a good teacher and sent twelve white students to do student teaching in her classroom at Dunbar. Dr. Christofferson, her mentor, who had recommended her for student teaching suggested she return to Miami to complete her master’s degree. Her masters project was called, <em>What Are The Relationships, If Any, Between Social And Economic Backgrounds And School Achievement</em>. Her thesis professor was Dr. Edmiston. Her goal was to see if kids with the most money received the best grades; she tested this theory on one hundred and fifty ninth graders at Dayton Dunbar High School. After that, she served as Principal of Booker T. Washington School in Middletown. She taught math at MHS in her final years before retiring in 1980. She was a lifelong active member of Delta Kappa Gamma (KΣΔ), a professional educator organization for women founded in 1929, and remained an active member the rest of her life. Louise married Herbert McBain on December 20, 1941. Herbert was the maintenance superintendent of the grounds in Middletown Regional Hospital. They had one daughter named Zee Whitetaker, and two grandsons. On September 17, 1989 Louise passed away at the age of seventy nine after an extended battle with cancer. In 1989 Louise was honored by Miami University with the Bishop Medal, a recognition of her extraordinary career as a student and educator. The Bishop Medal, established in 1936, is given to individuals who have distinguished themselves in service to humanity. The Bishop Medal is named after Robert Hamilton Bishop, Miami’s first president. Louise Clark McBain embraced the life of being a Miami student and her long career in education meant she graced hundreds, perhaps thousands, of other students with her guidance and wisdom.</p>
